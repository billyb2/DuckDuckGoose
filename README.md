# DuckDuckGoose
A game I made in 7th grade, uploading it so I don't lose it. I might finish the first boss fight eventually (probably never).
WASD to move the blue goose, and q to shoot
Arrow keys to move the red duck, with N to shoot

The purple bar is the boss's health, the yellow bars are platforms.
